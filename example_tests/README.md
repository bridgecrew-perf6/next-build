# Example Tests

This directory contains example tests. Their purpose is to give a gentle introduction to the test tools used in this project.

To run _all_ of the tests on _all_ of the examples, run `yarn test:examples` from the root directory.

To run

## 01. Hello, world!

This is an extremely basic "Hello, world!" sort of application, and has a correspondingly simple test.

## 02. Hello, world! (but asynchronously)

Promises can complicate testing. This shows two simple ways of dealing with that.
